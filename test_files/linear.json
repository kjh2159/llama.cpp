No two walls are parallel, and no three walls have a common point.

        "2. First method: Find the digits $a, b, c$ such that the number $\\overline{387 a b c}$ is divisible by 5, 6, and 7. Any even number divisible by 5 ends in 0, so $c=0$. For divisibility by 3, it is necessary that $3+8+7+a+b=18+a+b$ is divisible by 3. Since 18 is divisible by 3, $a+b$ must be divisible by 3. Let's take the smallest number divisible by 6 and 5, which is 387030. Direct verification shows that this number is also divisible by 7, and therefore is the desired number. If we add $210=5 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7$ to this number, its divisibility by 5, 6, and 7 will not change. Therefore, 387240, 387450, 387660, 387870 are also solutions.\n\nSecond method: A number divisible by 5, 6, and 7 is divisible by $210=5 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7$ and has the form $210k$.

Glancing at the top card (let's say it's a seven), place it face down on the table, then, continuing to count out loud in order: \"Eight, nine, ten...\" and so on up to 12, lay out other cards from the deck on top of it. Since the bottom card is a seven, a stack of 6 cards will form on the table.\n\nTake another look at the top card of the remaining part of the deck (let's say, for example, it's a \"former queen\" - now a ten), place it face down on the table, and, continuing to count in order up to 12, lay out one card from the deck on the table with each count. This time, the stack will have 3 cards (10, 11, 12). Continue doing this until you exhaust the entire deck. If at the end of the layout there are not enough cards in the deck to complete a full stack (up to the count of 12), set the incomplete stack aside.\n\nNow tell me how many stacks you have and how many cards you set aside, and I will immediately tell you the sum of the values of the bottom cards in all the stacks. To do this, I simply multiply 13 by the number of stacks minus 4, and add the number of cards set aside. For example, if there are 6 stacks and 5 extra cards, then 13, multiplied by 2 (6 minus 4), plus 5 equals 31, the sum of the bottom cards.\n\nWhy does this work?",

The commander discovered that if the soldiers are lined up by height, there is a certain pattern in the change of their demand functions. The demand for buckwheat porridge of the shortest soldier is given by $Q d=510-5.1 P$, the next tallest soldier's demand is $Q d=520-5.2 P$, the next one's is $Q d=530-5.3 P$, and so on. The commander's individual demand for buckwheat porridge is $Q d=500-5 P$. The battalion commander always tries to feed as many soldiers as possible. Apart from the commander and the invited soldiers, no one else demands buckwheat porridge. At the festival, 25 perfectly competitive firms offer buckwheat porridge, with each firm's supply function being $Q s=302 P$. The battalion commander, after consulting with his family, decided to make a surprise - initially, the guests and the commander will make decisions about consuming buckwheat porridge, assuming that everyone will pay for it themselves, but at the end of the celebration, the commander's family will pay the total bill from their savings, which amount to 2,525,000 monetary units. If this amount is insufficient, the commander will ask all guests to equally share the remaining bill. It is known that the equilibrium price is set at 20 monetary units. Assume that if guests, like the commander, have to make a certain fixed payment, this payment does not affect their demand for buckwheat porridge.\n\n(a) How is the individual demand of the 60th soldier invited to the celebration described?

        "Consider $n$ lamps clockwise numbered from $1$ to $n$ on a circle.\n\nLet $\\xi$ to be a configuration where $0 \\le \\ell \\le n$ random lamps are turned on. A [i]cool procedure[/i] consists in perform, simultaneously, the following operations: for each one of the $\\ell$ lamps which are turned on, we verify the number of the lamp; if $i$ is turned on, a [i]signal[/i] of range $i$ is sent by this lamp, and it will be received only by the next $i$ lamps which follow $i$, turned on or turned off, also considered clockwise. At the end of the operations we verify, for each lamp, turned on or turned off, how many signals it has received. If it was reached by an even number of signals, it remains on the same state(that is, if it was turned on, it will be turned on; if it was turned off, it will be turned off). Otherwise, it's state will be changed.\n\nThe example in attachment, for $n=4$, ilustrates a configuration where lamps $2$ and $4$  are initially turned on. Lamp $2$ sends signal only for the lamps $3$ e $4$, while lamp $4$ sends signal for lamps $1$, $2$, $3$ e $4$. Therefore, we verify that lamps $1$ e $2$ received only one signal, while lamps $3$ e $4$ received two signals. Therefore, in the next configuration, lamps $1$ e $4$ will be turned on, while lamps $2$ e $3$ will be turned off.\n\nLet $\\Psi$ to be the set of all $2^n$ possible configurations, where $0 \\le \\ell \\le n$ random lamps are turned on.

        "5. We took ten consecutive natural numbers greater than 1, multiplied them, found all the prime divisors of the resulting number, and multiplied these prime divisors (taking each exactly once). What is the smallest number that could have resulted? Fully justify your answer.\n\nSolution. We will prove that among ten consecutive numbers, there must be a number that has a prime divisor different from $2, 3, 5, 7$. Let's count how many of the ten consecutive numbers can have the specified four divisors. Out of ten numbers, exactly five are divisible by 2, and at least one of these five numbers is divisible by 3. (This fact can be taken for granted in the work, but let's recall one possible proof. The remainders from dividing six consecutive numbers by 6 form a set from 0 to 5, i.e., there is a number with a remainder of 0, which is divisible by both 2 and 3.) Further, the set of ten numbers contains at least three and no more than four numbers that are divisible by 3. If there are three such numbers, at least one of these three is divisible by 2 and has already been counted. If there are four such numbers, they have the form $3k, 3k+3, 3k+6, 3k+9$. Depending on the parity of $k$, either $3k, 3k+6$ or $3k+3, 3k+9$ are divisible by 2. Thus, when considering numbers divisible by 3, we can add no more than two new numbers to the five even numbers already counted. Ten consecutive numbers contain exactly two numbers that are divisible by 5, one of which is even and has already been counted. Therefore, divisibility by 5 adds no more than one number to the seven already counted. Among ten consecutive numbers, no more than two are divisible by 7, one of which is even and has already been counted. Divisibility by 7 adds no more than one number to the eight already counted. Thus, among ten consecutive numbers, no more than nine have at least one of the divisors $2, 3, 5, 7$, i.e., there is a number with a larger prime divisor and not divisible by any of the first four prime numbers. Therefore, in the product of ten numbers, there will be at least one divisor different from $2, 3, 5, 7$, so the product of all prime divisors will be greater than 210. The smallest possible product is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 = 2310$.",

Find the angles of the rhombus. Solution.\n\nThe notation is shown in the figure. The situation where angle $D$ of the rhombus is acute is impossible (see below). Mark point $P$ on side $AB$ such that $AP=EB=FC$. Triangles $CDF$ and $ADP$ are congruent, as they have equal angles $\\angle A=\\angle C$ and corresponding equal sides $AD=DC, AP=FC$. Considering that triangle $FED$ is equilateral by the condition, we get that triangle $EDP$ is isosceles $(ED=FD=PD)$. (At this point, note that if angle $\\angle A$ of the rhombus is obtuse, then angle $\\angle APD$ is acute, and in the isosceles triangle $EDP$, the angle at the base is obtuse,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_aa449fffebf3e1dc9820g-3.jpg?height=499&width=1037&top_left_y=116&top_left_x=521)\n\nwhich is impossible). Mark the equal angles $x=\\angle A=\\angle C$ and $y=\\angle ADP=\\angle CDF$. We find $\\angle EPD=x+y$ (the exterior angle of triangle $ADP$) and $\\angle PDE=180^{\\circ}-2(x+y)$.

After proving that triangle $EDP$ is isosceles, note that its exterior angles are equal: $\\angle APD=\\angle BED$. From this, triangles $ADP$ and $BED$ are congruent by the two indicated angles and sides $(AP=EB, PD=ED)$. Therefore, $BD=AD$, and triangle $ABD$ is equilateral. Thus, $\\angle BAD=60^{\\circ}$.",

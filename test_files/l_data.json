        "202. Indicate the number of steps sufficient to assert with an error probability not exceeding 0.001 that the reduced speed of the chip is less than 0.01.\n\nLet us recall now that each movement of the chip is conditioned by the result of tossing a coin. If, in $n$ tosses of the coin, heads appear $l$ times and tails appear $n-l$ times, the chip will make $l$ steps to the right and $n-l$ steps to the left and will end up at the point\n\n$$\nl-(n-l)=2 l-n\n$$\n\nThe reduced speed of the chip over $n$ steps will be expressed by the absolute value of the ratio\n\n$$\n\\frac{2 l-n}{n}=2 \\frac{l}{n}-1\n$$\n\nThe fraction $\\frac{l}{n}$ characterizes the frequency of heads appearing.\n\nSuppose a certain allowable error probability is given. As we know, for large values of $n$, it can be asserted with practical certainty that the reduced speed is close to zero. From expression (8), it is clear that if the reduced speed is small, then $2 \\frac{l}{n}$ is approximately equal to 1 and, consequently, the frequency $\\frac{l}{n}$ is close to $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus:\n\nIf a coin is tossed a large number of times, it is practically certain that the frequency of heads appearing will be close to $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nRoughly speaking, it is practically certain that heads will appear in about half of the cases. A more precise formulation states:\n\nChoose an arbitrary allowable error probability $\\varepsilon$ and specify any arbitrarily small number $\\alpha$. If the number of coin tosses exceeds\n\n$$\nN=\\frac{1}{\\alpha^{2} \\sqrt[3]{\\varepsilon^{2}}}\n$$\n\nthen with an error probability less than $\\varepsilon$, it can be asserted that the frequency of heads appearing differs from $\\frac{1}{2}$ by less than $\\alpha$.\n\nThe proof of this precise formulation easily follows from statement b) on page 151: if $n>\\frac{1}{\\alpha^{2} \\sqrt[3]{\\varepsilon^{2}}}$, then\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}<\\alpha \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{e} \\text { and } \\frac{\\frac{2}{\\sqrt[3]{\\varepsilon}}}{\\sqrt{n}}<2 \\alpha\n$$\n\nThus, with an error probability less than $\\varepsilon$, the reduced speed of the chip is less in absolute value than $2 \\alpha$.\n\nBut the reduced speed in our case is the absolute value of $\\frac{2 l-n}{n}=2 \\frac{l}{n}-1$. Therefore, with an error probability less than $\\varepsilon$, it can be asserted that $2 \\frac{l}{n}$ differs from 1 by less than $2 \\alpha$ or, in other words, $\\frac{l}{n}$ differs from $\\frac{1}{2}$ by less than $\\alpha$.",
        "10. $n>10$ teams take part in a soccer tournament. Each team plays every other team exactly once. A win gives two points, a draw one point and a defeat no points. After the tournament, it turns out that each team has won exactly half of its points in the games against the 10 worst teams (in particular, each of these 10 teams has scored half of its points against the 9 remaining teams). Determine all possible values of $n$, and give an example of such a tournament for these values.\n\n## 1st solution\n\nWe call the 10 worst teams the losers, the $n-10$ best teams the winners. We repeatedly use the following fact: If $k$ teams play against each other, then the total number of points won is exactly $k(k-1)$. We count the total number of points won in two ways. On the one hand, this is exactly $n(n-1)$. On the other hand, the 10 losers in the games among themselves receive exactly $10 \\cdot 9=90$ points. By assumption, this is exactly half of the total number of points that these 10 teams have achieved. Consequently, the total number of points scored by the losers is 180. The $n-10$ winners scored a total of $(n-10)(n-11)$ points in the games among themselves. Again, this is half of the total number of points, the latter is therefore equal to $2(n-10)(n-11)$. A comparison yields the equation\n\n$$\nn(n-1)=180+2(n-10)(n-11)\n$$\n\nThis is equivalent to $n^{2}-41 n+400=0$ and has the solutions $n=16$ and $n=25$.\n\nAccording to the above calculations, it also follows that the average score of the $n-10$ winners is equal to 2( $n-11)$, the average score of the 10 losers is equal to 18.\n\nOf course, $2(n-10) \\geq 18$ must now apply, i.e. $n \\geq 20$. Consequently, $n=16$ is not possible.\n\nFinally, we show that such a tournament exists for $n=25$. The 10 losers always play to a draw among themselves, as do the $n-10$ winners among themselves. The following diagram shows the games of the 15 winners $G_{i}$ against the 10 losers $V_{j}$. Where 2 means a win for $G_{i}$, 0$ a win for $V_{j}$ and 1 a draw.\n\n| | $G_{1}$ | $G_{2}$ | $G_{3}$ | $G_{4}$ | $G_{5}$ | $G_{6}$ | $G_{7}$ | $G_{8}$ | $G_{9}$ | $G_{10}$ | $G_{11}$ | $G_{12}$ | $G_{13}$ | $G_{14}$ | $G_{15}$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $V_{1}$ | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 |\n| $V_{2}$ | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 |\n| $V_{3}$ | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 |\n| $V_{4}$ | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 |\n| $V_{5}$ | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 |\n| $V_{6}$ | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 |\n| $V_{7}$ | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 2 |\n| $V_{8}$ | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 2 |\n| $V_{9}$ | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 |\n| $V_{10}$ | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 |\n\nIn total, the final score of each winner is 28, of which exactly 14 points come from games against the losers. Each loser has a final score of 18, half of which again comes from games against the other losers. This shows everything.\n\n## 2nd solution\n\nHere is another example of such a tournament. Again, the losers and the winners play each other to a draw. Now assume that a winner never loses to a loser. A winner scores a total of 14 points against the other winners, so he must also score 14 points against the losers. To do this, he must win four times and draw six times. Similarly, each loser draws nine times. We can now divide the $10 \\times 15$ table from above into $2 \\times 3$ boxes and obtain the following table with the same notations:\n\n| | $G_{1}, G_{2}, G_{3}$ | $G_{4}, G_{5}, G_{6}$ | $G_{7}, G_{8}, G_{9}$ | $G_{10}, G_{11}, G_{12}$ | $G_{13}, G_{14}, G_{15}$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $V_{1}, V_{2}$ | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 |\n| $V_{3}, V_{4}$ | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 |\n| $V_{5}, V_{6}$ | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| $V_{7}, V_{8}$ | 1 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 |\n| $V_{9}, V_{10}$ | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 1 |",

        "Among the pairs of integers $(a, b)$ such that $1 \\leqslant a \\leqslant b \\leqslant 5$, how many are there for which $a$ and $b$ are coprime?\n\nMoreover, there are also other numbers, much better known to the general public, which have remarkable divisibility properties: these are the prime numbers.\n\n## Definition 2.2.12.\n\nWe say that an integer $n$ is prime if $n$ has exactly 2 positive divisors, which are 1 and $n$. Otherwise, we say that $n$ is composite.\n\n## Remark 2.2.13.\n\nThe integer 1 is therefore not prime!\n\nFrom the definition of prime numbers, the following crucial results quickly follow.\n\n## Theorem 2.2.14.\n\nLet $n$ be an integer and $p$ a prime number. Either $p$ divides $n$, or $p$ is coprime with $n$, these two cases being mutually exclusive.\n\nProof. First, if $p$ divides $n$, then $p$ is a common divisor of $p$ and $n$, so $p \\wedge n \\neq 1$, which shows that $p$ and $n$ are not coprime. Now suppose that $p$ does not divide $n$, and let $d = p \\wedge n$. Since $d$ divides $p$, we know that $d = 1$ or $d = p$. Since $d$ divides $n$, it follows that $d \\neq p$, and therefore $d = 1$.\n\n## Theorem 2.2.15.\n\nLet $n$ be an integer such that $n \\geqslant 2$, and let $p$ be the smallest divisor of $n$ such that $p \\geqslant 2$. Then the integer $p$ is a prime number.\n\nProof. Since $p \\geqslant 2$, we already know that 1 and $p$ are two distinct divisors of $p$. Now let $d$ be a divisor of $p$. According to Theorem 2.2.3, and since $p$ divides $n$, we know that $d$ also divides $n$. By the minimality of $p$, we deduce that $d = 1$ or $d = p$, which means that $p$ is prime.\n\nIt is therefore very important to be able to detect whether an integer $n$ is prime or not. Achieving this efficiently is a difficult question, which will be the subject of the course on \"primality tests\" given to group D. However, there is already an ancient and relatively efficient method when $n$ is small: it is the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which allows identifying the set of prime numbers less than or equal to $n$.\n\nLike the Euclidean algorithm, it is important to show that the Sieve of Eratosthenes returns the correct list of prime numbers $p \\leqslant n$.\n\n## Theorem 2.2.16.\n\nThe list of integers returned by the Sieve of Eratosthenes is indeed the list of prime numbers $p \\leqslant n$.\n\n```\nAlgorithm 2: Sieve of Eratosthenes\n    Argument(s): \\(n \\quad \\triangleright\\) We want to identify the prime numbers \\(p \\leqslant n\\)\n    write all integers from 2 to \\(n\\)\n    as we go, we will either cross them out or circle them\n    while there is an integer \\(p \\leqslant \\sqrt{n}\\) that is neither crossed out nor circled:\n        choose the smallest such integer \\(p\\) and circle it\n        cross out all multiples of \\(p\\) between \\(p^{2}\\) and \\(n\\) that were not already crossed out\n    return the list of integers that were not crossed out (even those that are not circled)\n```\n\nProof. Our proof will proceed by induction on $n$. First, if $n = 1$, the result is obvious. We therefore assume that $n \\geqslant 2$ and that, if we run the Sieve of Eratosthenes with $n-1$ as the argument, it returns the correct list of prime numbers $p \\leqslant n-1$. Let's then see how it behaves when we give it $n$ as the argument.\n\nAlready, it is clear that the integers $k \\leqslant n-1$ that we will cross out are the same, whether the argument of the algorithm is $n-1$ or $n$. It remains to show that we will cross out $n$ if it is composite, but not if it is prime.\n\nIf $n$ is prime, we will clearly never cross it out. We therefore treat the case where $n$ is composite. Let $p$ then be its smallest divisor such that $p \\geqslant 2$. Theorem 2.2.15 shows that $p$ is prime. Moreover, since $n = p \\times (n / p)$ and $p < n$, we know that $n / p$ is a divisor of $n$ greater than or equal to 2, so $n / p \\geqslant p$. This shows that $p \\leqslant \\sqrt{n}$.\n\nSince $p$ is prime, we will never cross it out, so we will eventually circle it. By doing so, and since $n \\geqslant p^{2}$, we will necessarily cross out $n$. This concludes the proof of the theorem.",

These points will help us find the interval where $|f(x)| \\leq 5$.\n\n1. Solve $f(x) = 5$:\n   \\[\n   ax^2 + 8x + 3 = 5 \\implies ax^2 + 8x - 2 = 0\n   \\]\n   Using the quadratic formula $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, we get:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 + 8a}}{2a} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 + 8a}}{2a}\n   \\]\n   Let the roots be $x_1$ and $x_2$.\n\n2. Solve $f(x) = -5$:\n   \\[\n   ax^2 + 8x + 3 = -5 \\implies ax^2 + 8x + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   Using the quadratic formula again, we get:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 32a}}{2a} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 32a}}{2a}\n   \\]\n   Let the roots be $x_3$ and $x_4$.\n\nThe interval where $|f(x)| \\leq 5$ is between the smallest and largest roots of these equations. We need to find the value of $a$ that maximizes the length of this interval.\n\nThe length of the interval is given by the difference between the largest and smallest roots. For the interval to be maximized, the roots should be as far apart as possible. This occurs when the discriminants of the quadratic equations are maximized.\n\nFor the equation $ax^2 + 8x - 2 = 0$, the discriminant is:\n\\[\n\\Delta_1 = 64 + 8a\n\\]\nFor the equation $ax^2 + 8x + 8 = 0$, the discriminant is:\n\\[\n\\Delta_2 = 64 - 32a\n\\]\n\nTo maximize the interval, we need to balance these discriminants. The maximum interval length occurs when the roots of the two equations are symmetric around the vertex of the parabola. The vertex of the parabola $f(x) = ax^2 + 8x + 3$ is at:\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{8}{2a} = -\\frac{4}{a}\n\\]\n\nFor the interval to be symmetric around the vertex, the roots of the equations should be equidistant from the vertex. This occurs when the discriminants are equal:\n\\[\n64 + 8a = 64 - 32a \\implies 40a = 0 \\implies a = -2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting $a = -2$ into the equations, we get:\n\\[\nx_1, x_2 = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 16}}{-4} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{48}}{-4} = \\frac{-8 \\pm 4\\sqrt{3}}{-4} = 2 \\mp \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\\[\nx_3, x_4 = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 + 64}}{-4} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{128}}{-4} = \\frac{-8 \\pm 8\\sqrt{2}}{-4} = 2 \\mp 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nThe interval where $|f(x)| \\leq 5$ is between the smallest and largest roots:\n\\[\nl(a) = (2 + \\sqrt{3}) - (2 - 2\\sqrt{2}) = \\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of $a$ that maximizes $l(a)$ is $a = -2$, and the maximum $l(a)$ is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{2}}\n\\]",

On the first row, the position of the rook can be chosen in 8 ways. For example, we choose the first cell with the number 0. On the second row, there are 7 options left. Six of them (cells from the second to the seventh) have the property that under them in the lower half of the board are numbers different from the number occupied by the first rook (in our case, 0), and one cell (the last one, with the number 7) is such that under it in the lower half stands the number occupied by the first rook (in our case, 0).\n\nConsider the first group of 6 options and make an arbitrary choice (for example, the second cell with the number 1). After such a choice, it turns out that in the lower half of the board, positions with two different numbers are prohibited (in our case, 7 and 6). Therefore, positions with these numbers need to be chosen in the upper half of the board, and there are exactly 2 such options (in our case, the 7th and 8th cells in rows 3 and 4). After this choice, in the lower half of the board, there will be 4 columns with different numbers in the columns. That is, in the lower half, there are \\(4! = 24\\) options. Thus, we get \\(8 \\times 6 \\times 2 \\times 24\\) options.\n\nConsider the option of choosing a position on the second row when under the chosen cell in the lower half of the board stands the number chosen on the first row (in our case, the last cell with the number 7). After such a choice, in the third row, there are 6 options leading to a single option in the fourth row. After choosing options in the upper half of the board, in the lower half, there are again 4 free columns with four different numbers, i.e., 24 options. Thus, we get \\(8 \\times 1 \\times 6 \\times 24\\) options.\n\nIn total, we get:\n\n\\(8 \\times 6 \\times 2 \\times 24 + 8 \\times 1 \\times 6 \\times 24 = 3456\\).",

        "4. Let's fix a point $O$ on the plane. Any other point $A$ is uniquely determined by its radius vector $\\overrightarrow{O A}$, which we will simply denote as $\\vec{A}$. We will use this concept and notation repeatedly in the following. The fixed point $O$ is conventionally called the initial point. We will also introduce the symbol $(A B C)$ - the simple ratio of three points $A, B, C$ lying on the same line; points $A$ and $B$ are called the base points, and point $C$ is the dividing point. The symbol $(A B C)$ is a number determined by the formula:\n\n$$\n\\overrightarrow{C A}=(A B C) \\cdot \\overrightarrow{C B}\n$$\n\nFurthermore, for two collinear vectors $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$, there is a unique number $\\lambda$ such that $\\vec{a}=\\lambda \\vec{b}$.

Then $r(x)$ is the unique polynomial such that\n\\[g(x^{12}) - r(x) = x^{60} + x^{48} + x^{36} + x^{24} + x^{12} + 1 - r(x)\\]\nis divisible by $g(x) = x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$, and $\\deg r(x) < 5$.\nNote that $(x - 1)(x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + 1) = x^6 - 1$ is a multiple of $g(x)$. Also,\n\\[g(x^{12}) - 6 = x^{60} + x^{48} + x^{36} + x^{24} + x^{12} - 5 \\\\ = (x^{60} - 1) + (x^{48} - 1) + (x^{36} - 1) + (x^{24} - 1) + (x^{12} - 1).\\]\nEach term is a multiple of $x^6 - 1$. For example,\n\\[x^{60} - 1 = (x^6 - 1)(x^{54} + x^{48} + \\dots + x^6 + 1).\\]\nHence, $g(x^{12}) - 6$ is a multiple of $x^6 - 1$, which means that $g(x^{12}) - 6$ is a multiple of $g(x)$. Therefore, the remainder is $\\boxed{6}$. The answer is (A).\n\nSolution 2\nWe express the quotient and remainder as follows.\n\\[g(x^{12}) = Q(x) g(x) + R(x)\\]\nNote that the solutions to $g(x)$ correspond to the 6th roots of unity, excluding $1$. Hence, we have $x^6 = 1$, allowing us to set:\n\\[g(x^{12}) = 6\\]\n\\[g(x) = 0\\]\nWe have $5$ values of $x$ that return $R(x) = 6$. However, $g(x)$ is quintic, implying the remainder is of degree at most $4$. Since there are $5$ solutions, the only possibility is that the remainder is a constant $\\boxed{6}$.\n\nSolution 3\nWe can use the Chinese remainder theorem over $\\mathbb{Q}[x].$ Since $g(x)=(x+1)(x^2-x+1)(x^2+x+1)$, $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/g\\cong \\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x+1)\\times \\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2-x+1)\\times \\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2+x+1).$ This means that if we can find the remainder of $g(x^{12})$ modulo $x+1,x^2-x+1,x^2+x+1$, we can reconstruct the remainder modulo $g.$ We can further use that each factor is irreducible and that if $p(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ with root $\\alpha$, $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/p\\cong \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$ so to evaluate the remainders of $g(x^{12})$, we just need to evaluate it on one of the roots of the irreducible factors. The first factor has root $-1$, the second has roots the primitive sixth roots of unity, and the third as roots the primitive cube roots of unity (this is easily seen as $g(x)(x-1)=x^6-1$). Evaluating $g(x^{12})$ on each of these values yields $g(1)=6$ so the remainder is $6$ on each factor on the right of the isomorphism.

        "Find the remainder of the Euclidean division of $x^{100}-2 x^{51}+1$ by $x^{2}-1$.\n\n## - Roots and factorization of polynomials\n\nHere we see that the knowledge of the roots of a polynomial allows us to factorize it. Recall that $\\mathbb{K}$ denotes $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nDefinition 1.10. An element $x \\in \\mathbb{K}$ is called a root of a polynomial $P \\in \\mathbb{K}[X]$ if $P(x)=0$.\n\nExample 1.11. The real polynomial $X^{2}-1$ has two real roots, which are 1 and -1. The polynomial $X^{2}+1$ has no real roots. The real polynomial $X^{2}-2$ has two real roots, but the polynomial with rational coefficients $X^{2}-2$ has no rational roots because $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.\n\nTheorem 1.12. Let $P \\in \\mathbb{K}[X]$ and $a \\in \\mathbb{K}$. The following two propositions are equivalent:\n\n1. a is a root of $P$, that is, $P(a)=0$.\n2. There exists a polynomial $Q \\in \\mathbb{K}[X]$ such that:\n\n$$\nP(x)=Q(x)(x-a) \\text {. }\n$$\n\nProof. It is clear that the second point implies the first. As for the converse, the key is to use Euclidean division. Indeed, suppose that $P(a)=0$. Then write the Euclidean division of $P$ by $X-a$ in the form $P(x)=Q(x)(x-a)+R(x)$ with $R$ a polynomial of degree at most $1-1=0$. Thus, $R$ is a real number, denoted by $c$. In short, $P(x)=Q(x)(x-a)+c$. Evaluate this quantity at $x=a: 0=P(a)=Q(a)(a-a)+c$. Therefore, $c=0$, which is what we wanted to prove.\n\nTheorem 1.13. A polynomial of degree $n$ has at most $n$ different roots.\n\nProof. By contradiction, let $P \\in \\mathbb{R}[X]$ of degree $n$ having at least $n+1$ different roots, denoted $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n+1}$. According to the previous theorem, there exists a polynomial $Q$ such that $P(x)=$ $Q(x)\\left(x-r_{1}\\right)$. But then, for $2 \\leq i \\leq n+1,0=P\\left(r_{i}\\right)=Q\\left(r_{i}\\right)\\left(r_{i}-r_{1}\\right)$. Since $r_{i}-r_{1} \\neq 0$, this implies $Q\\left(r_{i}\\right)=0$. We repeat this reasoning with $Q$ to finally obtain the existence of a polynomial $T$ such that $P(x)=T(x)\\left(x-r_{1}\\right) \\cdots\\left(x-r_{n+1}\\right)$. Then, according to Proposition 1.6:\n\n$$\nn=\\operatorname{deg}(P)=\\operatorname{deg} T+n+1>n\n$$\n\nwhich is absurd.\n\nRemark 1.14. There exist polynomials that have no real roots, for example $P(x)=$ $x^{4}+1$.\n\nThis important theorem implies some corollaries giving information about the polynomial given something about its roots.\n\nCorollary 1.15. Let $P(x)=a_{0}+a_{1} x+\\cdots+a_{n} x^{n}$ be a polynomial of degree $n$. Suppose it has $n$ different roots $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$. Then:\n\n$$\nP(x)=a_{n}\\left(x-r_{1}\\right) \\cdots\\left(x-r_{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nProof. By revisiting the previous proof, we see that there exists a polynomial $T$ such that $P(x)=T(x)\\left(x-r_{1}\\right) \\cdots\\left(x-r_{n}\\right)$. By comparing the degrees of the terms on the left and right, it follows that $T$ is of degree zero, hence a real number. By looking at the leading coefficient on both sides of the equality, we find that $T(x)=a_{n}$.\n\nCorollary 1.16. A polynomial of degree $n$ having $n+1$ roots is zero. Thus, a polynomial having an infinite number of roots is necessarily the zero polynomial.",

This means that the circumcircle of $\\triangle ADE$ passes through $F$.\n\nNow, consider the circumcircle of $\\triangle ABD$ and the circumcircle of $\\triangle AEC$. Since $\\angle DAE = \\angle CAF$, the points $A, D, E, F$ lie on a common circle. Therefore, the circumcircle of $\\triangle ABD$ and the circumcircle of $\\triangle AEC$ intersect at points $A$ and $E$.\n\nThus, the circumcircle of $\\triangle ABD$ and the circumcircle of $\\triangle AEC$ are **intersecting** at points $A$ and $E$.\n\n(2) Given that the circumradius of $\\triangle ABD$ is twice that of $\\triangle AEC$, and $BC = 6$, $AB = 4$, we need to find the length of $BE$.\n\nLet the circumradius of $\\triangle AEC$ be $R$ and the circumradius of $\\triangle ABD$ be $2R$.\n\nUsing the circumradius formula for a triangle:\n\\[ R = \\frac{abc}{4K} \\]\nwhere $a, b, c$ are the sides of the triangle and $K$ is the area of the triangle.\n\nFor $\\triangle AEC$:\n\\[ R = \\frac{AE \\cdot AC \\cdot EC}{4K_{AEC}} \\]\n\nFor $\\triangle ABD$:\n\\[ 2R = \\frac{AB \\cdot AD \\cdot BD}{4K_{ABD}} \\]\n\nSince $AB = 4$ and $BC = 6$, let $BE = x$ and $EC = 6 - x$.\n\nUsing the fact that the circumradius of $\\triangle ABD$ is twice that of $\\triangle AEC$, we can set up the following relationship:\n\\[ 2 \\left( \\frac{AE \\cdot AC \\cdot EC}{4K_{AEC}} \\right) = \\frac{4 \\cdot AD \\cdot BD}{4K_{ABD}} \\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[ 2 \\left( \\frac{AE \\cdot AC \\cdot (6 - x)}{4K_{AEC}} \\right) = \\frac{4 \\cdot AD \\cdot (x + 4)}{4K_{ABD}} \\]\n\nSince the areas $K_{AEC}$ and $K_{ABD}$ are proportional to the product of the sides, we can simplify further:\n\\[ 2 \\left( \\frac{AE \\cdot AC \\cdot (6 - x)}{4K_{AEC}} \\right) = \\frac{4 \\cdot AD \\cdot (x + 4)}{4K_{ABD}} \\]\n\nGiven that the circumradius relationship holds, we can solve for $x$:\n\\[ 2 \\left( \\frac{AE \\cdot AC \\cdot (6 - x)}{4K_{AEC}} \\right) = \\frac{4 \\cdot AD \\cdot (x + 4)}{4K_{ABD}} \\]\n\nSince the areas are proportional, we can simplify to:\n\\[ 2(6 - x) = x + 4 \\]\n\nSolving for $x$:\n\\[ 12 - 2x = x + 4 \\]\n\\[ 12 - 4 = 3x \\]\n\\[ 8 = 3x \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{8}{3} \\]\n\nThus, the length of $BE$ is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\frac{8}{3}} \\]",

In the pyramid $FABC$, $AB=BC$, $FB=FK$, where $K$ is the midpoint of the segment $AC$, and the tangent of the angle between the planes $FAB$ and $ABC$ is in the ratio of 1:3 to the tangent of the angle between the planes $FBC$ and $ABC$. The plane $\\pi$ is parallel to $AB$, divides the edge $FC$ in the ratio $1:4$, counting from the vertex $F$, and passes through the base $O$ of the height $FO$ of the pyramid $FABC$. Find the ratio of the volumes of the polyhedra into which this plane divides the pyramid $FABC$.\n\n## Answer: $5: 11$ or $1: 19$.\n\nSolution: 1) We will prove that the base of the height (point $O$) lies on the midline of $\\triangle ABC$. Triangles $FOB$ and $FOK$ are equal (they are right triangles, $FO$ is common, and $FB=FK$), so $BO=OK$. In the plane of the base $ABC$, draw a line $l$ passing through point $O$ parallel to $AC$ and denote $L=l \\cap BK$, $M=l \\cap AB$, $N=l \\cap BC$. Since $AB=BC$, the median $BK \\perp AC$, and thus $OL \\perp BK$. Then triangles $BOL$ and $KOL$ are equal (they are right triangles with a common $OL$ and equal $BO=OK$), so $BL=KL$, i.e., $MN$ is the midline of triangle $ABC$.\n\n2) Find the ratio $OM:ON$. From point $O$, draw perpendiculars $OH_1$ to side $AB$ and $OH_2$ to side $BC$ and denote $\\angle FH_1O=\\alpha$, $\\angle FH_2O=\\beta$. The plane $FOH_1$ is perpendicular to the plane $ABC$ and the lateral face $FAB$, i.e., $\\alpha$ is the angle between the planes $FAB$ and $ABC$. Similarly, $\\beta$ is the angle between the planes $FBC$ and $ABC$. From triangles $FOH_1$ and $FOH_2$, we find $OH_1=FO \\cdot \\operatorname{ctg} \\alpha$, $OH_2=FO \\cdot \\operatorname{ctg} \\beta$. From the condition, it follows that $OH_1:OH_2=3:1$. Triangles $OMH_1$ and $ONH_2$ are similar (they are right triangles and $\\angle OMH_1=\\angle ONH_2$), so $OM:ON=3:1$.\n3) First case. Suppose that point $O$ lies inside triangle $ABC$. In the plane $ABC$, draw a line $m$ through point $O$ parallel to $AB$. By the condition, this line lies in the cutting plane $\\pi$. Denote $P=m \\cap AC$, $Q=m \\cap BC$. From Thales' theorem, $BQ=3QN$. Since $MN$ is the midline, we get $CQ:CB=CP:CA=5:8$. Denote the point of intersection of the plane $\\pi$ and the edge $FC$ as $R$ - by the condition $CR:CF=4:5$. Thus, the plane $\\pi$ intersects the edges $AC$, $BC$, and $FC$ at points $P$, $Q$, and $R$, respectively, so\n\n$$\n\\frac{V_{CPQR}}{V_{CABF}}=\\frac{CP \\cdot CQ \\cdot CR}{CA \\cdot CB \\cdot CF}=\\frac{5}{8} \\cdot \\frac{5}{8} \\cdot \\frac{4}{5}=\\frac{5}{16}\n$$\n\nThen the volumes of the polyhedra $CPQR$ and $ABQPRF$ are in the ratio $5:11$.\n\n4) Second case. Suppose that point $O$ lies outside triangle $ABC$. Then $MN:ON=2:1$. Similarly, we get $BN:NQ=2:1$, and since $MN$ is the midline, $CQ:CB=CP:CA=1:4$. Then $V_{CPQR}:V_{CABF}=1:20$. Then the volumes of the polyhedra $CPQR$ and $ABQPRF$ are in the ratio $1:19$.",

Let $n$ be the smallest positive integer such that $S(n)+S(n+1)=2016$. As the answer to the problem, write down a five-digit number such that its first two digits coincide with the first two digits of $n$ and its last three digits coincide with the last three digits of $n$. For example, if $\\mathrm{n}=1234567890$, then the answer must be 12890.\n\n## Answer.\n\n59989\n\n## Solution\n\nIf the number $n$ does not end in 9, then $S(n+1)=S(n)+1$, and the sum $S(n)+S(n+1)$ is odd, which means it cannot equal 2016. Therefore, the number $n$ must end in 9. If it ends in one 9, then $S(n+1)=S(n)-8$, and thus $S(n)=1012$. The smallest number with such a sum of digits is 599...989 (the total number of 9s is 111). If the number of 9s at the end of $n$ is not less than two, then by similar reasoning, the sum $S(n)$ will be larger, and the number $n$ will also be larger. Therefore, the answer is 59989.\n\n12.

Since $M_1R \\parallel DK$, then $\\frac{RK}{CK} = \\frac{M_1D}{CD} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Then $RK = \\frac{CK}{2} = \\frac{b}{4}$, $SR = SK - RK = \\frac{b}{4}$. Moreover, $PR \\parallel DK$, $\\frac{SP}{PD} = \\frac{SR}{RK} = 1$. Therefore, $SP = PD = \\frac{b}{2}$. Since $P$ is the midpoint of edge $SD$ and $M$ is the midpoint of base $AD$, then $PM$ is the midline of triangle $ADS$ and $PM = \\frac{AS}{2} = \\frac{b}{2}$, $PM \\parallel AS$. Similarly, we can obtain that $QN = \\frac{AS}{2} = \\frac{b}{2}$, $QN \\parallel AS$. Therefore, quadrilateral $PMQN$ is a parallelogram. We will prove that it is a rectangle. Indeed, the projection of $AC$ of edge $AS$ is the diagonal of the square $ABCD$. Therefore, $AC$ is perpendicular to the diagonal $BD$, and since $BD \\parallel MN$, then $AC$ is perpendicular to $MN$. Hence, $AS$ is perpendicular to $MN$. Since $PM \\parallel AS$, it follows that $PM$ is perpendicular to $MN$. Thus, the section $NMPRQ$ consists of a rectangle $PMQN$ with sides $MN = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}$ and $PM = \\frac{b}{2}$ and an isosceles triangle $PQR$ with base $PQ = \\frac{b}{2}$ and height $RF$. Let's find the area of the rectangle: $MN \\cdot PM = \\frac{ab}{2\\sqrt{2}}$. Since $\\frac{CR}{RS} = \\frac{CO}{OA} = 3$, then $\\frac{OR}{AS} = \\frac{CO}{OA} = \\frac{3}{4}$. From this, we get $OR = \\frac{3b}{4}$, and $FR = \\frac{3b}{4} - \\frac{b}{2} = \\frac{b}{4}$. Then the area of triangle $PQR$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{b}{4} = \\frac{ab}{8\\sqrt{2}}$. The area of the section $NMPRQ$ is: $\\frac{ab}{2\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{ab}{8\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{5ab}{8\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{5ab\\sqrt{2}}{16}$. Substituting $a = 1$, $b = 2$, we find $S = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{8}$.",

Let's make the substitution of variables:\n\n$$\n3^{2 x^{2}-3 x+1}=u, \\alpha=\\pi x+\\frac{7 \\pi n}{6}\n$$\n\nThe equation can be transformed into:\n\n$$\n\\log _{2}\\left(u^{2}-6 u+17\\right)=\\frac{6\\left(2 \\log _{2} \\sin \\alpha+1\\right)}{\\left(2 \\log _{2} \\sin \\alpha+1\\right)^{2}+1}\n$$\n\nNow let's introduce the variable $t: t=2 \\log _{2} \\sin \\alpha+1$. Then the right-hand side of the equation can be transformed into:\n\n$$\ng(t)=\\frac{6 t}{t^{2}+1}\n$$\n\nThe function $g(t)$ is negative for negative values of the argument, and for positive values, it can be represented as:\n\n$$\ng(t)=\\frac{6}{t+\\frac{1}{t}}\n$$\n\nfrom which it is clear that the function takes its maximum value when the denominator is positive and minimal. This occurs at $t=1$, i.e., when $\\alpha=\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2 \\pi k$. At this point, the maximum value of the right-hand side of the equation is 3. The left-hand side of the equation\n\n$$\nf(u)=\\log _{2}\\left(u^{2}-6 u+17\\right)=\\log _{2}\\left((u-3)^{2}+8\\right) \\geqslant 3\n$$\n\nis always greater than or equal to 3 and achieves its minimum value at $u=3$.

The first of these equations in terms of the variable $n$ reduces to the equation $n=\\frac{3+12 k}{7}$, which has a unique solution $n=9$ on the given interval of natural numbers. The second equation reduces to the equation: $n=\\frac{12 k-6}{7}$, which has a unique solution $n=6$.",

We get ${ }^{1} \\frac{a}{a+c}=\\frac{b}{b+d}$, from which $a d=b c$.\n\nDue to random variability in the data, this equality may not be exact, but it should hold at least approximately.

Then $a$ is approximately (rounded to the nearest integer) $\\frac{b c}{d}=\\frac{1110 \\cdot 978}{121} \\approx 8972$, and the total number of respondents is approximately $8972+1110+978+121=11181$.

        "1. On an $8 \\times 8$ chessboard, tokens are placed according to the following rule. Initially, the board is empty. A move consists of placing a token on any free square. With this move, exactly one of the tokens that ends up adjacent to it is removed from the board (if there is such an adjacent token). What is the maximum number of tokens that can be placed on the board, considering the specified rule? Adjacent squares are those that are nearest horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. Solution.\n\nThe number of tokens on the board can be increased by one only when a new token is placed on a completely free square, i.e., a square all of whose adjacent squares are free of tokens.\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_cca78509636089d39cb9g-1.jpg?height=748&width=1678&top_left_y=1022&top_left_x=201)\n\nLet's highlight one horizontal row A1-H1, see the figure. We can fill this row with tokens from left to right. To do this, we will place the tokens in sequence, as shown in the figure. The numbers in circles indicate the sequence of placing the tokens. A crossed-out number means removing a token when placing an adjacent one. When filling the bottom row, each subsequent token removes the previous one from the board, so placing a token with an odd number in the row A1-H1 removes the previous even-numbered token from the row A2-H2. To place a token on the H1 field, we first need to place token number 14 on the H3 field, then token number 15 on the H2 field, removing the previous one. Finally, we can place token number 16 on the corner field H1, removing token number 15 from the board.\n\nNext, we can fill all the horizontal rows up to A6-H6 in a similar manner. Rows A7-F7 and A8-F8 will have to be filled differently, as there are not enough free squares above them. The order of filling the two vertical squares A7 and A8 is shown in the second figure. To fill them, we need to start twice from the C8 field. This way, we will reach the F7 and F8 fields. We cannot move further to the right, as there is no free field except for the H8 field. We can place a token on this field and, if we wish to fill the G8 field, remove the token from the H8 field. Thus, we have shown how to fill the board with 61 tokens. There are other sequences of placements and other final arrangements of 61 tokens.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_cca78509636089d39cb9g-2.jpg?height=951&width=1033&top_left_y=324&top_left_x=523)\n\nIt remains to prove that it is impossible to place 62 tokens. Suppose 61 tokens are placed on the board. The three free squares do not allow us to select one that does not have any adjacent occupied squares. The minimum number of sides of a free square that can adjoin another free square is two, in the corner of the board. Therefore, the minimum necessary number of free neighbors is three, taking into account the diagonally adjacent square, see the figure.",

Then, from the beginning of the year, [365/7] = 52 (in a leap year [366/7] = 52) full weeks pass, each of which has exactly one Friday. In addition, at the end of the year, there are 365 - 7 * 52 = 1 or 366 - 7 * 52 = 2 days left. One of these remaining days can be a Friday.

Let $S$ be the sum of the numbers on each line. Then the sum of the numbers on all five lines is 5S. Since each circle lies at the intersection of two lines, each number in a circle is counted twice. Therefore, the sum we found is twice the sum of all the placed numbers, i.e., $5S = 2(4 \\cdot 1 + 3 \\cdot 2 + 3 \\cdot 3)$. We get $5S = 38$, which is impossible because on each line there are 4 integers and their sum must be an integer.\n\n## Task 3\n\nIntegers $a$ and $b$ are such that $96a = 73b$.

Then $73(a + b) = 73a + 73b = 73a + 96a = 169a$. Since the numbers 73 and 169 are coprime, $a + b$ is divisible by 169.

Each experience of throwing the circle corresponds to a point $M-$ the position of the center of the circle on the vertical segment $[A ; B]$ of length 1.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_8b002ac84843a2e42fafg-05.jpg?height=315&width=702&top_left_y=1016&top_left_x=382)\n\nLet's introduce the following notations: $R$ - the radius of the circle, $O$ - the midpoint of the segment $[A ; B], \\quad O M=x \\in[0 ; 0.5]$ - a random variable uniformly distributed on this segment, $\\alpha$ - the angle indicated in the figure, $A M=h=\\frac{\\cos \\alpha}{2}$.\n\nThe area of the circular segment $S_{1}$ of a circle with radius $R$ is given by the formula:\n\n$$\nS_{1}=\\left|\\alpha R^{2}-\\frac{1}{2} R^{2} \\sin 2 \\alpha\\right|\n$$\n\nIn our case, $R=\\frac{1}{2}$, so,\n\n$$\nS_{1}=\\frac{\\alpha}{4}-\\frac{\\sin 2 \\alpha}{8} .\n$$\n\nFrom the problem statement, it follows that\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c}\nS_{1}: S_{2}=(\\pi-2):(3 \\pi+2) \\\\\nS_{1}+S_{2}=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nThen $S_{1}=k(\\pi-2)$, and $S_{2}=k(3 \\pi+2)$. Substituting this into the second equality, we get: $S_{1}+S_{2}=k \\cdot 4 \\pi=\\frac{\\pi}{4}$. Therefore, $k=\\frac{1}{16}$. Then, $S_{1}=\\frac{\\alpha}{4}-\\frac{\\sin 2 \\alpha}{8}=\\frac{1}{16}(\\pi-2)$. From this, we find $\\alpha=\\frac{\\pi}{4}$. Thus, the conditions of the problem correspond to the central angle $P M Q$ equal to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Then $h=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}$ and the favorable outcome of the experiment corresponds to points $M$ that are no more than $\\frac{1}{2}-h=\\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{4}$ away from point $O$. Since the probability of the desired event is the ratio of the length of the segment of \"favorable\" outcomes, i.e., $\\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ to the length of the segment $[A ; B]$, i.e., to one, the desired probability $P(A)=\\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\approx 0.29$",
        "We inscribed the regular hexagon $A B C D E F$ in a circle, then drew semicircles outward over the chords $A B, B D, D E$, and $E A$. Calculate the ratio of the total area of the 4 lens-shaped (bounded by two circular arcs) figures that formed to the area of the hexagon.\n\nLet's start by calculating the area of the regular hexagon. The area of a regular hexagon with side length $s$ is given by:\n\\[ T_{\\text{hexagon}} = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the area of the lens-shaped figures. Each lens is formed by the intersection of two semicircles. The radius of each semicircle is equal to the side length of the hexagon, $s$. The area of each semicircle is:\n\\[ T_{\\text{semicircle}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi s^2 \\]\n\nThe area of the lens-shaped figure can be found by subtracting the area of the equilateral triangle formed by the two radii and the chord from the area of the semicircle. The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is:\n\\[ T_{\\text{triangle}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \\]\n\nThus, the area of one lens-shaped figure is:\n\\[ T_{\\text{lens}} = T_{\\text{semicircle}} - T_{\\text{triangle}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi s^2 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 = \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\right) s^2 \\]\n\nSince there are 4 such lens-shaped figures, the total area of the lens-shaped figures is:\n\\[ T_{\\text{total lenses}} = 4 \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\right) s^2 = \\left( 2\\pi - \\sqrt{3} \\right) s^2 \\]\n\nFinally, the ratio of the total area of the lens-shaped figures to the area of the hexagon is:\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{T_{\\text{total lenses}}}{T_{\\text{hexagon}}} = \\frac{\\left( 2\\pi - \\sqrt{3} \\right) s^2}{\\frac{3 \\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2} = \\frac{2\\pi - \\sqrt{3}}{\\frac{3 \\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{2(2\\pi - \\sqrt{3})}{3 \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{4\\pi - 2\\sqrt{3}}{3 \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{4\\pi - 2\\sqrt{3}}{3 \\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{4\\pi \\sqrt{3} - 6}{9} = \\frac{4\\pi \\sqrt{3} - 6}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the ratio is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\frac{4\\pi \\sqrt{3} - 6}{9}} \\]",

After substituting the variables $X=\\sqrt{|x-1|}, \\sqrt{3|y|}$, we obtain the system:\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\nX+Y=1 \\\\\nX^{4}+Y^{4}=-a \\\\\nX \\geqslant 0, Y \\geqslant 0\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nEach solution $\\left(X_{0}, Y_{0}\\right)$ of this system such that $0<X_{0}<1,0<Y_{0}<1, X_{0} \\neq Y_{0}$ generates exactly four distinct solutions of the original system. Therefore, either $X_{0}=$ $Y_{0}=\\frac{1}{2}$, in which case $-a=\\frac{1}{2^{4}}+\\frac{1}{2^{4}}=\\frac{1}{8}$, or $X_{0}=1, Y_{0}=0$ and $X_{0}=0, Y_{0}=1$, in which case $-a=1+0=0+1$.\n\nVerification. Consider the function $f(t)=t^{4}+(1-t)^{4}$. Since the derivative $f^{\\prime}(t)=4\\left(t^{3}-(1-t)^{3}\\right)$ is zero only at the point $t=1 / 2$, for $t \\in[0 ; 1]$ we obtain the estimate $\\frac{1}{8}=f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\leqslant f(t) \\leqslant f(1)=f(0)=1$. Therefore, when $a=-\\frac{1}{8}$, there is only one solution of the system satisfying $(X, Y), X \\geqslant 0, Y \\geqslant 0$, namely $\\left(X_{0}, Y_{0}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, which generates four solutions of the original system. When $a=-1$, there are only two solutions of the system satisfying $(X, Y), X \\geqslant 0, Y \\geqslant 0$, namely $\\left(X_{0}, Y_{0}\\right)=(0,1),(1,0)$, which also generates four solutions of the original system.",

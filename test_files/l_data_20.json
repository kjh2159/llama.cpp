        "202. Indicate the number of steps sufficient to assert with an error probability not exceeding 0.001 that the reduced speed of the chip is less than 0.01.\n\nLet us recall now that each movement of the chip is conditioned by the result of tossing a coin. If, in $n$ tosses of the coin, heads appear $l$ times and tails appear $n-l$ times, the chip will make $l$ steps to the right and $n-l$ steps to the left and will end up at the point\n\n$$\nl-(n-l)=2 l-n\n$$\n\nThe reduced speed of the chip over $n$ steps will be expressed by the absolute value of the ratio\n\n$$\n\\frac{2 l-n}{n}=2 \\frac{l}{n}-1\n$$\n\nThe fraction $\\frac{l}{n}$ characterizes the frequency of heads appearing.\n\nSuppose a certain allowable error probability is given. As we know, for large values of $n$, it can be asserted with practical certainty that the reduced speed is close to zero. From expression (8), it is clear that if the reduced speed is small, then $2 \\frac{l}{n}$ is approximately equal to 1 and, consequently, the frequency $\\frac{l}{n}$ is close to $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus:\n\nIf a coin is tossed a large number of times, it is practically certain that the frequency of heads appearing will be close to $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nRoughly speaking, it is practically certain that heads will appear in about half of the cases. A more precise formulation states:\n\nChoose an arbitrary allowable error probability $\\varepsilon$ and specify any arbitrarily small number $\\alpha$. If the number of coin tosses exceeds\n\n$$\nN=\\frac{1}{\\alpha^{2} \\sqrt[3]{\\varepsilon^{2}}}\n$$\n\nthen with an error probability less than $\\varepsilon$, it can be asserted that the frequency of heads appearing differs from $\\frac{1}{2}$ by less than $\\alpha$.\n\nThe proof of this precise formulation easily follows from statement b) on page 151: if $n>\\frac{1}{\\alpha^{2} \\sqrt[3]{\\varepsilon^{2}}}$, then\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}<\\alpha \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{e} \\text { and } \\frac{\\frac{2}{\\sqrt[3]{\\varepsilon}}}{\\sqrt{n}}<2 \\alpha\n$$\n\nThus, with an error probability less than $\\varepsilon$, the reduced speed of the chip is less in absolute value than $2 \\alpha$.\n\nBut the reduced speed in our case is the absolute value of $\\frac{2 l-n}{n}=2 \\frac{l}{n}-1$. Therefore, with an error probability less than $\\varepsilon$, it can be asserted that $2 \\frac{l}{n}$ differs from 1 by less than $2 \\alpha$ or, in other words, $\\frac{l}{n}$ differs from $\\frac{1}{2}$ by less than $\\alpha$.",
        "10. $n>10$ teams take part in a soccer tournament. Each team plays every other team exactly once. A win gives two points, a draw one point and a defeat no points. After the tournament, it turns out that each team has won exactly half of its points in the games against the 10 worst teams (in particular, each of these 10 teams has scored half of its points against the 9 remaining teams). Determine all possible values of $n$, and give an example of such a tournament for these values.\n\n## 1st solution\n\nWe call the 10 worst teams the losers, the $n-10$ best teams the winners. We repeatedly use the following fact: If $k$ teams play against each other, then the total number of points won is exactly $k(k-1)$. We count the total number of points won in two ways. On the one hand, this is exactly $n(n-1)$. On the other hand, the 10 losers in the games among themselves receive exactly $10 \\cdot 9=90$ points. By assumption, this is exactly half of the total number of points that these 10 teams have achieved. Consequently, the total number of points scored by the losers is 180. The $n-10$ winners scored a total of $(n-10)(n-11)$ points in the games among themselves. Again, this is half of the total number of points, the latter is therefore equal to $2(n-10)(n-11)$. A comparison yields the equation\n\n$$\nn(n-1)=180+2(n-10)(n-11)\n$$\n\nThis is equivalent to $n^{2}-41 n+400=0$ and has the solutions $n=16$ and $n=25$.\n\nAccording to the above calculations, it also follows that the average score of the $n-10$ winners is equal to 2( $n-11)$, the average score of the 10 losers is equal to 18.\n\nOf course, $2(n-10) \\geq 18$ must now apply, i.e. $n \\geq 20$. Consequently, $n=16$ is not possible.\n\nFinally, we show that such a tournament exists for $n=25$. The 10 losers always play to a draw among themselves, as do the $n-10$ winners among themselves. The following diagram shows the games of the 15 winners $G_{i}$ against the 10 losers $V_{j}$. Where 2 means a win for $G_{i}$, 0$ a win for $V_{j}$ and 1 a draw.\n\n| | $G_{1}$ | $G_{2}$ | $G_{3}$ | $G_{4}$ | $G_{5}$ | $G_{6}$ | $G_{7}$ | $G_{8}$ | $G_{9}$ | $G_{10}$ | $G_{11}$ | $G_{12}$ | $G_{13}$ | $G_{14}$ | $G_{15}$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $V_{1}$ | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 |\n| $V_{2}$ | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 |\n| $V_{3}$ | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 |\n| $V_{4}$ | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 |\n| $V_{5}$ | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 |\n| $V_{6}$ | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 |\n| $V_{7}$ | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 2 |\n| $V_{8}$ | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 2 |\n| $V_{9}$ | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 |\n| $V_{10}$ | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 |\n\nIn total, the final score of each winner is 28, of which exactly 14 points come from games against the losers. Each loser has a final score of 18, half of which again comes from games against the other losers. This shows everything.\n\n## 2nd solution\n\nHere is another example of such a tournament. Again, the losers and the winners play each other to a draw. Now assume that a winner never loses to a loser. A winner scores a total of 14 points against the other winners, so he must also score 14 points against the losers. To do this, he must win four times and draw six times. Similarly, each loser draws nine times. We can now divide the $10 \\times 15$ table from above into $2 \\times 3$ boxes and obtain the following table with the same notations:\n\n| | $G_{1}, G_{2}, G_{3}$ | $G_{4}, G_{5}, G_{6}$ | $G_{7}, G_{8}, G_{9}$ | $G_{10}, G_{11}, G_{12}$ | $G_{13}, G_{14}, G_{15}$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $V_{1}, V_{2}$ | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 |\n| $V_{3}, V_{4}$ | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 |\n| $V_{5}, V_{6}$ | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| $V_{7}, V_{8}$ | 1 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 |\n| $V_{9}, V_{10}$ | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 1 |",

        "Among the pairs of integers $(a, b)$ such that $1 \\leqslant a \\leqslant b \\leqslant 5$, how many are there for which $a$ and $b$ are coprime?\n\nMoreover, there are also other numbers, much better known to the general public, which have remarkable divisibility properties: these are the prime numbers.\n\n## Definition 2.2.12.\n\nWe say that an integer $n$ is prime if $n$ has exactly 2 positive divisors, which are 1 and $n$. Otherwise, we say that $n$ is composite.\n\n## Remark 2.2.13.\n\nThe integer 1 is therefore not prime!\n\nFrom the definition of prime numbers, the following crucial results quickly follow.\n\n## Theorem 2.2.14.\n\nLet $n$ be an integer and $p$ a prime number. Either $p$ divides $n$, or $p$ is coprime with $n$, these two cases being mutually exclusive.\n\nProof. First, if $p$ divides $n$, then $p$ is a common divisor of $p$ and $n$, so $p \\wedge n \\neq 1$, which shows that $p$ and $n$ are not coprime. Now suppose that $p$ does not divide $n$, and let $d = p \\wedge n$. Since $d$ divides $p$, we know that $d = 1$ or $d = p$. Since $d$ divides $n$, it follows that $d \\neq p$, and therefore $d = 1$.\n\n## Theorem 2.2.15.\n\nLet $n$ be an integer such that $n \\geqslant 2$, and let $p$ be the smallest divisor of $n$ such that $p \\geqslant 2$. Then the integer $p$ is a prime number.\n\nProof. Since $p \\geqslant 2$, we already know that 1 and $p$ are two distinct divisors of $p$. Now let $d$ be a divisor of $p$. According to Theorem 2.2.3, and since $p$ divides $n$, we know that $d$ also divides $n$. By the minimality of $p$, we deduce that $d = 1$ or $d = p$, which means that $p$ is prime.\n\nIt is therefore very important to be able to detect whether an integer $n$ is prime or not. Achieving this efficiently is a difficult question, which will be the subject of the course on \"primality tests\" given to group D. However, there is already an ancient and relatively efficient method when $n$ is small: it is the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which allows identifying the set of prime numbers less than or equal to $n$.\n\nLike the Euclidean algorithm, it is important to show that the Sieve of Eratosthenes returns the correct list of prime numbers $p \\leqslant n$.\n\n## Theorem 2.2.16.\n\nThe list of integers returned by the Sieve of Eratosthenes is indeed the list of prime numbers $p \\leqslant n$.\n\n```\nAlgorithm 2: Sieve of Eratosthenes\n    Argument(s): \\(n \\quad \\triangleright\\) We want to identify the prime numbers \\(p \\leqslant n\\)\n    write all integers from 2 to \\(n\\)\n    as we go, we will either cross them out or circle them\n    while there is an integer \\(p \\leqslant \\sqrt{n}\\) that is neither crossed out nor circled:\n        choose the smallest such integer \\(p\\) and circle it\n        cross out all multiples of \\(p\\) between \\(p^{2}\\) and \\(n\\) that were not already crossed out\n    return the list of integers that were not crossed out (even those that are not circled)\n```\n\nProof. Our proof will proceed by induction on $n$. First, if $n = 1$, the result is obvious. We therefore assume that $n \\geqslant 2$ and that, if we run the Sieve of Eratosthenes with $n-1$ as the argument, it returns the correct list of prime numbers $p \\leqslant n-1$. Let's then see how it behaves when we give it $n$ as the argument.\n\nAlready, it is clear that the integers $k \\leqslant n-1$ that we will cross out are the same, whether the argument of the algorithm is $n-1$ or $n$. It remains to show that we will cross out $n$ if it is composite, but not if it is prime.\n\nIf $n$ is prime, we will clearly never cross it out. We therefore treat the case where $n$ is composite. Let $p$ then be its smallest divisor such that $p \\geqslant 2$. Theorem 2.2.15 shows that $p$ is prime. Moreover, since $n = p \\times (n / p)$ and $p < n$, we know that $n / p$ is a divisor of $n$ greater than or equal to 2, so $n / p \\geqslant p$. This shows that $p \\leqslant \\sqrt{n}$.\n\nSince $p$ is prime, we will never cross it out, so we will eventually circle it. By doing so, and since $n \\geqslant p^{2}$, we will necessarily cross out $n$. This concludes the proof of the theorem."
